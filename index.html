			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<img src="prison1.png" alt="Introduction Image">
			<p>The United States penal system provides an endless supply of moral issues that continue to be revealed to the public. For instance, in recent years, activist movements have brought attention to the prevalence of violent policing practices. Each step, from initial arrest, trial, to incarceration, present opportunities for different kinds of bias to corrupt fair justice. Here, we will examine how prisoners are categorized by their potential to reoffend when released back into society, and whether this process is as efficient and free of bias as it should be. 
				</p>
				<p>Over-incarceration is a uniquely American problem, in fact, the US has the highest incarceration rate out of any country in the world, and on average at least three times the rate compared to other NATO-aligned, first world countries (Herring). This does not correlate with higher levels of crime, or even violent crimes: the incarceration rate is lower in countries that have higher crime rates than the US, and violent crime has been on a decline since high rates during the nineties. Despite this, crime is very important to voters, and ranks high in their concerns during election seasons (Gramlich). This disconnect between the prevalence of violent crimes and the high incarceration rate point is due to many arrests for petty, nonviolent crimes, and an overall attitude of criminalization that is perpetuated not only by lawmakers but the American public. 
				</p>
				<p>However, things have not always been this way. Throughout history, the punishment of criminals has been considered a method of warding off future crimes, but has traditionally been associated with punishment proportional to the severity of the crime (Incarceration., 322). Additionally, much of the utility of prisons has historically been associated with rehabilitation. In recognition of the poor socioeconomic and cultural conditions that contribute to criminal activity, many have seen incarceration as less of a sentence, and more an opportunity to build up practical life skills that can aid prisoners when released and decrease the likelihood of re-offending. This changed in the 1970’s, when the climate in the US was heavily charged by increasing unrest, such as the war on drugs and fervent protesting. The idea of proportional punishment began to fade into the background, replaced by a politicized desire to crack down on crime (Incarceration., 321). Robert Martison’s skepticism about rehabilitation programs created a “nothing works mentality” that led to the abandonment of many rehabilitation programs, and little has been done to repair this since (Benecchi). 
				</p>
				<p>This created a culture in which prisoners are stigmatized and shunned, even for small petty crimes, and treated with severity while inside the prison system. Prisoners do not benefit from all of the rights and protections that normal US Citizens do, either. In many states, prisoners are barred from voting, and some counties have even exploited this to redraw voting lines to create inflated voting power (Florida Justice Institute). In these cases, prisoners are subjected to clear cases of gerrymandering, in addition to losing one of their core constitutional rights. Prisoners are also exploited for their labor, and under-payed for it. The 13th Amendment, which protects against slavery and involuntary servitude does not include those in confinement due to criminal conviction, and prisoners are paid pennies for hard manual labor used for industrial profit (ACLU). And, in alignment with the loss of rehabilitation goals, these jobs do not often create promising post-incarceration prospects. In fact, they typically lead nowhere, and do nothing to help ex-prisoners with the monumental task of landing a job once released. 
				</p>
				<p>These glaring issues are important to consider when looking at re-offense. Even if prisoners are deemed safe to release, they are hampered at every step by stereotypes, and barred from working in many places. These roadblocks create a negative environment that could make criminal activity all the more likely, in any population. Next, we’ll talk about measuring the risk of re-offense, or Recidivism, and how that process is also potentially flawed. </p>

			<h2>Recidivism</h2>
			<img src="prison2.png" alt="Section 1 Image" id="medium-image">

			<p>Recidivism is the relapse into criminal behavior from an individual. Predicting recidivism has become an important part of determining incapacitation, specific deterrence, and rehabilitation (National Institute of Justice). This is done by using risk assessments, which are systems that identify and evaluate processes, situations, or individuals for potential risks that may cause harm, particularly to others. It can be split into two parts:  Risk and Needs Assessment (RNA) and Risk and Needs Responsivity (RNR) (Jackson and Mendoza). The risk principle targets who should be treated, and those who are high and medium risk are targeted more while those who are low risk are targeted less. The need principle is what the individual is being targeted for. It is focused on treating criminogenic needs. The responsivity principle is how to treat an individual and is focused on rehabilitation. The risk factors that are involved are the Static Risk Factors and Dynamic Risk Factors. Static Risk Factors are factors of an individual that cannot be changed, such as previous criminal history and age. On the other hand Dynamic Risk Factors are those that could potentially change, such as substance abuse, mental health, and low income. 
				</p>
				<p>One of the most popular and common risk assessment tool used by the U.S. Justice System is Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions, or alternatively COMPAS, which is a statistically based AI used to determine if an offender is likely to recidivate, and is a fourth generation risk assessment model. COMPAS as a risk assessment, is based solely off of RNA rather than both RNA and RNR like other risk assessments use. This may pose a problem as it does not concern itself with rehabilitation. COMPAS collects data from two sources: public criminal profile data and an 137 interview questionnaire. It works by using several different theories to guide the assessment. These include:
				</p>
				<p>--Strain Theory - social structure may pressure individuals to commit crime
				</p>
				<p>--Low Self-Control Theory - those who were insufficiently parented before the age of ten were likely to lack self control
				</p>
				<p>--Social Control Theory - an individual who is able to commit to conventional society is not likely to become socially deviant
				</p>
				<p>--Routine Activities–Opportunity Theory - crime is committed based on the opportunity that is presented and the situation of the crime
				</p>
				<p>--Social Learning Theories - individuals imitate the behaviors and learn from those around them
				</p>
				<p>--Good Lives Perspective - rehabilitation that addresses limitations of traditional RNR
				</p>
				<p>With the implementation of these additional theories, it has been reported to have high levels of accuracy in predicting general recidivism, violence and failure to appear for court.
				</p>
				<p>This use COMPAS is a form of Algocracy, or government by algorithm, which has seen an increase of reliance in recent years and can be defined as the usage of computer algorithms that can be applied from anywhere from law enforcement to transportation. This has posed many concerns about the moral implications of using such technology not only for the threat of data protection and privacy, but allowing algorithms that may use illegitimate processes that may cause harm to the general public who is subject to them (Danaher). It has also been criticized for the use of third-party, for-profit companies, such as COMPAS. This poses as a threat as many of these companies are a “black box”, meaning they do not reveal their methodologies. For example in the case of State v. Loomis in 2016, defendant Eric Loomis was charged in a drive-by shooting he denies involvement in but pled guilty for attempting to flee from a traffic officer. The court ordered an investigation which resulted in an investigation report which included the use of COMPAS. Eric Loomis argued that this violated his due process rights as he nor the courts was not aware of his score, or how the score was calculated. His plea was rejected by the court, who stated that COMPAS did not have to reveal its methodologies for how they calculated his score (Harvard Law Review).</p>

			<p>Data Analysis:</p>

				<p>Our data analysis examines the “compas-scores-two-years” dataset, which is a collection of data on individuals who were assessed for their recidivism risk using the COMPAS algorithm in Broward County, Florida between 2013 and 2014. The dataset contains demographic information, conviction and arrest history, and COMPAS risk scores for over 7,000 individuals. The dataset also includes recidivism statistics for two years following the COMPAS assessment, allowing for an evaluation of the accuracy of the risk scores. The variables of note in this dataset are age, sex, race, name, number of prior convictions, COMPAS score, recidivism, violent COMPAS score, and violent recidivism. This information allowed us to perform an analysis of the factors that contribute to recidivism and conduct an assessment of the accuracy and fairness of the COMPAS predictive algorithm.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Regression Analysis of Recidivism on Risk Score:</p>
				<p>The regression analysis of recidivism on risk score reveals that risk scores are a significant predictor of recidivism. However, the R-squared value of only 12.4% indicates that other factors may also influence recidivism rates. Therefore, risk scores alone are likely not sufficient to make effective decisions regarding recidivism, nor should they be weighed too heavily in their legal applications.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Effects of Race on Risk Score and Recidivism:</p>
				<p>A regression analysis of recidivism and risk score on race shows that race might disproportionately impact risk scores more than it does the likelihood to recidivate, as being black or being white explains more of the variation in risk scores than it does in recidivism. This suggests that race may be a critical factor in determining risk scores. However, the regression also revealed that being black positively affected risk score and recidivism while being white negatively affected risk score and recidivism, which points to a potential bias in the algorithm. Although black recidivism rates are higher in reality, this can be due to several unrelated factors like racism in policing or the criminal justice system, which both inflate recidivism rates. Factors like these should not be used to justify higher risk scores for all black people.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Regression Analysis of Risk Score on Age, Priors Count, and Sex:</p>
				<p>Further regressions of risk score and recidivism on age, sex, and number of prior offenses reveal that age has a significant negative impact on both risk score and recidivism, while number of prior offenses has a significant positive effect on both risk score and recidivism. Being male also has a positive and significant effect on both risk score and recidivism, albeit with a smaller impact as the R-squared is less than 1%. All of these variables did have statistically significant effects, which reinforces the notion that numerous factors are involved in determining recidivism.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Summary Stats for White vs. Black Defendants:</p>
				<p>A comparison of summary statistics for white and black defendants reveals that black defendants have a higher number of prior crimes, higher rates of recidivism, and higher risk scores than white defendants. Black defendants also have higher rates of violent recidivism and higher violent risk scores. Notably, the percent increase in risk scores for black defendants compared to white defendants was higher than the percent increase in recidivism rates. This disparity indicates a potential trend in the algorithm, where risk scores are disproportionately higher than recidivism rates for black defendants. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Our analysis of the COMPAS dataset raises important questions about the fairness and ethics of its applications in the criminal justice system. While risk scores can provide valuable insights, they should not be the sole factor in determining an individual's likelihood of reoffending. The results of our analysis suggest that the COMPAS algorithm may contain biases that disproportionately affect black individuals. The regressions models indicate that the impact of race on risk scores is greater than its impact on recidivism rates, and that being black positively affected risk scores and recidivism rates while being white had the opposite effect. These findings have significant implications for the use of predictive algorithms in the criminal justice system. The use of such algorithms to make decisions about bail, sentencing, or parole can perpetuate inequality and bias if the underlying data and algorithms are flawed. It is crucial to address and correct these biases to ensure these tools are fair, accurate, and do not contribute to systemic injustice.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The usage of norm groups made up of base scales, which might not adequately reflect all people and result in biased predictions, is one potential bias of COMPAS. Furthermore, predictions and judgments may be skewed as a result of the lack of transparency surrounding the weighting of each data item. A decision may be prejudiced as a result of the automation bias if the algorithm is used excessively. In addition, the algorithm could be biased in terms of race and socioeconomic status, as shown in a case study. COMPAS is still used in different criminal justice scenarios despite these possible biases. It uses a regression model to predict new offenses in a probation sample and uses the results to inform assessment, sentencing decisions, case management, and recidivism outcomes. Recidivism Risk Decile Score can be determined by converting the model into a decile score. The algorithm and data points used should be more transparent in order to increase COMPAS's accuracy and fairness. One way to prevent biased predictions is by using a norm group that is more diverse. Creating procedures for contesting results and addressing errors can also aid in minimizing potential biases. To guarantee that COMPAS is used in a reasonable and fair manner, the racial and socioeconomic prejudices revealed in the case study must be addressed.
				</p>
				<p>In order to make decisions more consistently and objectively, algorithms are a useful tool. Algorithms have the ability to advance equality and fairness by lowering the likelihood of bias and discrimination in decision-making. The use of algorithms is not without risks, though. For instance, biases and inequities in society may be perpetuated and amplified by the algorithm due to potential biases and inaccuracies in the data used to train it. Furthermore, there are significant ethical and legal concerns raised by the lack of accountability and transparency in the creation and usage of algorithms. The employment of algorithms in the criminal justice system brings to light the possible dangers and drawbacks of making all of your decisions based exclusively on data and algorithms. The use of algorithms in the criminal judicial system presents significant ethical and legal issues as well as problems concerning the place of technology and data in society. The effects of utilizing COMPAS on various racial and socioeconomic groups, the efficacy of the interventions and therapies suggested by COMPAS, and the ethical and legal ramifications of using algorithms in the criminal justice system are thus vital to take into account. We can employ algorithms responsibly and ethically while advancing justice and equality if we are aware of these factors.
