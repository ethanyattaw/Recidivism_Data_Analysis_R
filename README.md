Note: the R_Studio_Code.R file contains all the code used to analyze the recidivism data. The analysis and visualizations can be found within the middle of the Recidivism_Report.pdf file. All data for the project came from COMPAS Scores Two Years dataset, available online.

The report is a pdf screenshot of a website created with html/css. That code is in the index.html and style.css files. Here is a link to the actual website: https://data-and-society-website.on.drv.tw/325%20Website/
